				Welcome to my website, a place I hope I can turn into a decent lobby for learning. As an aspiring
				researcher and soon undergraduate freshman, I plan to document my findings and resources here, as well as 
				my current work and status.

				for the sake of whoever stumbles upon it, and of course, my own.
